            <p>
                <strong>Theme</strong>: Professionalism in software development <br/>
                <strong>Goal</strong>: Igniting change in software ecosystem, inspiring future leaders. <br/>
                <strong>Scrum Day Bandung 2017 is not a conference about Scrum basics or Scrum mechanics</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Scrum Day Bandung 2017 is an exclusive and intense 1-day business agility &amp; modern management with Scrum framework conference specifically for corporate leaders and managers. But we think Scrum Day Bandung 2017 is more than just a conference. We think it is a community movement in Indonesia towards software development ecosystem that emphasizes agility and professionalism. We think software is a business need for companies to be competitive in 21st century. We think agility should be extended beyond IT because agility is a business requirement not a software development methodology. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Scrum Day Bandung is where great minds come together. Scrum Day Bandung is a perfect place to be for leaders, managers and change agents who have concerns about business agility and profesionalism in software development ecosystem to meet, exchange experiences and support each other. Unlike other conferences in Indonesia where participants only leave the event with information or knowledge, at Scrum Day Bandung participants will feel inspired and empowered to make changes in their respective companies knowing that others will walk alongside them. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Scrum Day Bandung is an exclusive event for corporate leaders and managers. It will be the first business agility &amp; modern management conference with Scrum framework in Indonesia. We believe Scrum Day Bandung will set a new standard in Indonesia's software development ecosystem where professionalism is not an option. If you share our mission for a software development ecosystem that emphasizes agility and professionalism, join the movement and attend this 1-day annual conference. We would like to meet and interact with you at the conference. Together we can make changes for the better future.
